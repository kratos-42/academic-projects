# UDP-Management

## REVERSE PROXY

Abstract
--------

Just as the name sugguests, the purpose of this project is to create a Reverse Proxy to handle TCP connections (between a Web Server
and a remote client), by processing the state of the available servers using an UDP monitor. Let's take a look on a simple schema
describing the use case.
