# SIPL - SIMPLE IMPERATIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

A brief introduction to FLEX and YACC in order to produce a (incomplete) new programming language.


This is an incomplete project since it is not possible to execute many of the operations it was supposed to - although
the syantax and the semantics of the SIPL are defined (C base) using regular expressions, and so the compiler to it with the 
functionalities of YACC. The missing part is to treat the assembly code to perform the operations needed in a programming 
language (it is only possible to declare and recognizing variables, taking advantage of the hashtable in use).
