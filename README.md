# Operating-Systems

Stream processing creating multiple processes linked by pipes.



This project was divided in 2 phases:
  - In a first aproach, implement some components to be used on processing data;
  - Then create the network where each node processes a single task.
  
 
 
 Component modules:
    - [Const](./StreamProcessing/const.c)  
    - [Filter](./StreamProcessing/filter.c)  
    - [Spawn](./StreamProcessing/spawn.c)
